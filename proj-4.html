        Entrepreneurship is the creation or extraction of value.[1][2][3] With this definition, 
        entrepreneurship is viewed as change, generally entailing risk beyond what is normally 
       encountered in starting a business, which may include other values than simply economic ones.

        <p class="Big">
            Entrepreneurship is an act of being an entrepreneur, or "the owner or manager of a
             business enterprise who, by risk and initiative, attempts to make profits".
             Entrepreneurs act as managers and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise.
             Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies
             a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for
             its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist Jean-Baptiste Say provided a 
             broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it "shifts economic resources out
             of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield".
